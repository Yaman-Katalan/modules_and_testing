# modules_and_testing

**Lab Overview: Modules, Testing, and Recursion**

The lab is focused on strengthening skills in Python modules, unit testing, and recursion. It involves creating a Python project structured with specific folders for modules and testing, then implementing factorial functions using both iteration and recursion. Additionally, a "clumsy factorial" function is introduced as a stretch goal.

**Key Components of the Lab:**

1. **Project Structure:**
   - Set up a Python project with organized folders (`module_name` for modules, `test` for testing).
   - Use Git for version control, linking a local repository to a remote GitHub repository.

2. **Factorial Functions:**
   - Implement `factorial_iterative` and `factorial_recursion` functions in `factorial_module.py`.
   - `factorial_iterative` calculates factorial using iteration (loop).
   - `factorial_recursion` calculates factorial using recursion.

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Write unit tests for `factorial_iterative` and `factorial_recursion` in `test_factorial.py`.
   - Ensure test coverage for edge cases and expected outputs.
   - Optionally, write tests for the "clumsy factorial" function (`clumsy`).

4. **Stretch Goal: Clumsy Factorial Function:**
   - Implement the `clumsy` function in `factorial_module.py`.
   - The `clumsy` function calculates a "clumsy factorial" using a specific rotation of operations on integers.

**Lab Completion Workflow:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a local Git repository with the prescribed directory structure.
   - Initialize a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   - Implement the required functions and tests in Python files within the project structure.

2. **Testing:**
   - Run unit tests to ensure the correctness of the factorial functions and any additional functions (e.g., `clumsy`).
   - Handle and debug any failures or errors in the tests.

3. **Branching and PR:**
   - Create a new branch (`factorial`) to work on the lab feature.
   - Commit changes to the branch and push to the remote repository.
   - Create a pull request (PR) from the `factorial` branch to the `main` branch for code review and merging.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update the `README.md` file with a summary of the lab, setup instructions, function explanations, and testing requirements.
   - Include any additional information or notes relevant to the lab.
